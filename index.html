    <h3>Java game project</h3>
    <p>
  My Java game project is a 2D platform game with three levels that increase in difficulty as the levels also increase. My main challenges with this game was firstly the enemy movement for each level as I had to make sure that the enemy would not interfere with my collectibles if it was dynamic and only patrol a certain region that only my bird character would reach, another problem with the enemy was that I had to ensure it would affect my character once it collided with so that the character would lose lives instead of disappearing altogether and with collision detection my character would be able to shoot and kill of the enemy. The overall gameplay had to be seamless, so I had to think about the sounds for each collision that happens on every level or once entering the new level it would have a different feel to it so that each level would stand out with unique attributes given e.g., different platforms, enemies, backgrounds, and sound. Coming to the end of this project i can finally put together everything i leanrt throught the module with all the creative freedom given to me, learning about things like object oriented programming, create a a 2D game from scratch by working with different aspects to java to bring it all together, and also guis.
